pt_STATS
--------

pt_STATS is a simple story tracking system for Pivotal Tracker.
The system is designed for Heroku deployment.

SETUP
--------

The key config variables are located in config.yml

project_id = The ID of the PT project to be tracked
project_name = The project name: Displayed on the tracking screen
iteration_length = The Iteration length in weeks
iteration_seed = The beginning of iteration 1
api_token = The Pivotal Tracker api token (Optional: For security reasons you can provide the API key as needed)
test_ticket_id = required to test api links
test_ticket_name = the name corresponding to the test ticket
username = the username for access
hash_password = a bcrypt hashed password (Default is admin)
bucket_code = adjusts the postbin URL
proxy = set to auto to use ENV['HTTP_PROXY']
page_size = the pt_api limits api calls to return at most 3000 stories. Pt_stats will use pagination to cope with large databases. You can adjust the size of each page here.
pt_api = the URI of the Pivotal Tracker API. You shouldn't need to change this unless the address changes.


Alternatively, for ease of code maintenance, you can also use environmental variables, this is especially useful if deploying the same code across multiple projects, see: http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars
If specified, config vars will take precedence over the yaml config.

Config vars are
BUCKET_CODE, HASH_PASSWORD, USERNAME, PROJECT_ID, PROJECT_NAME, ITERATION_SEED, ITERATION_LENGTH, API_TOKEN

eg. use:
heroku config:add BUCKET_CODE=secreturl HASH_PASSWORD=bcryptedpassword USERNAME=admin PROJECT_ID=12345 PROJECT_NAME='my project' ITERATION_SEED='2012/01/16 00:00:00 UTC' ITERATION_LENGTH=2 API_TOKEN=optional
